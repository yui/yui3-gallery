set constants, so show in Constants menu

uif
	render as part of canvas
	invalid value simply displays red border -- need regex for number, since parseFloat('1.2.3') gives 1.2

sqrt(2)^(2^((2/3)^(2^2))) or 2^log(3/2,27) or log(3/2,27) - 2/3 looks wrong
2^2^2 - too much space between opening paren and base
log2(2) - base too close to open paren

|| (nary parallel)
variable should draw all but first char as subscript
smarter parenthesizing, e.g., 5+2/7

test expand selection:  (3^2)/(5+2/7)
