Dispatcher
    This tool is the implementation of Bubbling Library Dispatcher Plugin
    for YUI 3. Dispatcher satisfies a very common use-case: 
    As a developer, I want to execute scripts tags from an Ajax HTML response.

    * Internal refactor to provide access to some of the process during the 
      dispatcher phase through protected methods: _executeScript, _getScript, 
      _setContent, _purgeContent. More info about this here:

    * Introducing a new event called "error" to provide feedback on failure within
      the fetch process or the external script injection routine.
    * Making dispatcher smaller (using "instance" instead of "this" for better compression)
