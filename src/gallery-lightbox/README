The inspiration behind this project is of course the original Lightbox
(http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2).  This module will begin
by including a full port of Lightbox to YUI 3 and then I'll add functionality
as I go to allow for non-image content, additional options, etc.

This release is the first official release.  I'm currently supporting everything
the original Lightbox supports.  The official documentation is located at:
http://projects.sophomoredev.com/yui-gallery-lightbox.  This project is hosted at Github,
so feel free to fork it if you'd like to make modifications.
