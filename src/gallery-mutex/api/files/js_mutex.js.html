    * Most people believe that Since JavaScript does not provide a
    * multi-threaded shared memory environment, JavaScript is completely
    * free from concurrency issues.  This is true at a low level;
    * JavaScript developers don&#x27;t need to worry about race conditions
    * between multiple processes or threads writing to the same memory
    * location.  At a higher level, asynchronous operations still allow for
    * similar problems to occur.
    * 
    * Imagine a function that does the following:
    * &lt;ol&gt;
    *     &lt;li&gt;
    *         Check the value of a variable.
    *     &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
    *     &lt;li&gt;
    *         If the value is undefined:
    *         &lt;ol&gt;
    *             &lt;li&gt;
    *                 Make a request to a server.
    *             &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
    *             &lt;li&gt;
    *                 Receive data.
    *             &lt;li&gt;
    *                 Set the value of the variable.
    *             &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
    *         &lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
    *     &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
    *     &lt;li&gt;
    *         Pass the variable to a callback function.
    *     &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
    * &lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
    * 
    * It seems common for web applications to lazy load data like this as
    * needed.  Now imagine that there are several separate modules within a
    * web application which all require this data.  It&#x27;s possible for the
    * first module to call this function, the function sees that the value
    * is undefined, and sends a request to a server.  Then before the
    * request returns, the second module calls this function, the function
    * sees that the value is undefined and sends a request to a server.
    * Then before both of those requests return, the third module calls
    * this function, the function sees that the value is undefined and sends
    * a request to a server.  In this case, three requests are made to a server
    * for the same data.
    * 
    * It would be far better if the second and third calls to the function
    * just waited for the first request to complete.  Y.Mutex makes it
    * easier to accomplish this functionality.
    * 
    * Y.Mutex provides a concept of locking a resource.  Once an exclusive
    * resource lock is obtained, other parts of an application which
    * attempt to access the same resource, will have to wait until that
    * resource is unlocked.
    * 
    * The function above could be rewritten as follows:
    * &lt;ol&gt;
    *     &lt;li&gt;
    *         Obtain an exclusive lock for a variable.
    *     &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
    *     &lt;li&gt;
    *         Check the value of the variable.
    *     &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
    *     &lt;li&gt;
    *         If the value is undefined:
    *         &lt;ol&gt;
    *             &lt;li&gt;
    *                 Make a request to a server.
    *             &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
    *             &lt;li&gt;
    *                 Receive data.
    *             &lt;li&gt;
    *                 Set the value of the variable.
    *             &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
    *         &lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
    *     &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
    *     &lt;li&gt;
    *         Unlock the variable.
    *     &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
    *     &lt;li&gt;
    *         Pass the variable to a callback function.
    *     &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
    * &lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
    * 
    * This way, second or third or more calls to the function, before the
    * first request is complete, will always wait for the request to
    * complete instead of sending multiple unnecessary requests.
    * 
    * Just like locking in multi threaded applications, there are
    * disadvantages and dangers to locking.  There is a small amount of
    * overhead added to every resource access, even when the chances for
    * concurrency issues are very small.  Once a lock is obtained, it must
    * be unlocked; so error handling and time outs are important to ensure
    * that the entire application doesn&#x27;t break when something goes wrong.
    * It is possible to cause a deadlock when locking multiple resources at
    * once.
    * 
    * One advantage Y.Mutex has in JavaScript over other multi threaded
    * applications, the locks are asynchronous.  The application is not
    * blocked while waiting to acquire a lock.  Even if a deadlock occurs,
    * other parts of the application are not affected.  Y.Mutex also
    * provides multiple ways to cancel a particular lock, so there are
    * extra possibilities to recover from locking errors.
    * 
    * Y.Mutex offers exclusive locks, shared locks, and upgradable locks.
    * When a resource is locked by an exclusive lock, Y.Mutex guarantees
    * that no other locks will be granted for the resource until the
    * resource is unlocked.  When a resource is locked by a shared lock,
    * Y.Mutex allows the resource to be locked by an unlimited number of
    * other shared locks at the same time and&#x2F;or one single upgradable
    * lock.  When a resource is locked by multiple shared locks, an
    * exclusive lock can not be obtained until all of the shared locks have
    * been unlocked.  An upgradable lock can be upgraded to act as an
    * exclusive lock.  Shared locks are generally used when just reading
    * values.  Exclusive locks are generally used when writing values.
    * 
    * Y.Mutex provides a way to deal with asynchronous concurrency issues,
    * but it does not prevent them.  If code from part of an application
    * uses Y.Mutex to lock a resource, there is nothing stopping code from
    * another part of the application from ignoring the lock and accessing
    * the resource directly.  Y.Mutex does not handle real multi threaded or
    * multi process concurrency issues.
