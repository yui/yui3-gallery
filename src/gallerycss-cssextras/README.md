gallerycss-cssextras
====================

Simple CSS for all those common UI elements that a web application needs. 


What is it?
-----------

`gallerycss-cssextras` is a [YUI Gallery](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/) module that makes it easy to style common UI elements by just adding class names. Take a look at the [examples and docs](http://tilomitra.github.com/cssextras/).


What about older browsers?
--------------------------

Since it's all CSS, nothing breaks in older browsers. This module is tested on IE6+, Chrome, FF and Safari. For best results, use IE8+. IE6 and 7 have some minor vertical alignment issues.


Dependencies
------------

* [normalize.css 1.x](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/) Pull this in before you start using CSSExtras.
* [cssbutton](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/button/#usecssbutton) if you wish to adopt the button styles.
